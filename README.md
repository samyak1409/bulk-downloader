# Bulk Downloader (Using [Web Scraping](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_scraping))


## What the project does

This project can be used to download any type of files (downloadable) from a given URL in bulk! 

### Why the project is useful

Sometimes we need all the data (files) downloaded from a particular website, and so it becomes a very time-taking and tedious task if there is no option for downloading them all at once. This is when [this](Script.py) project comes into the picture! Just connect to a fast Wi-Fi, give it that URL and sit back with a coffee, and this project will do the good for you! üòâ


## Installing the Dependencies

After downloading this project to your PC, open the project folder, there, open your [command-line interpreter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_command-line_interpreters#:~:text=In%20computing%2C%20a%20command-line%20interpreter%2C%20or%20command%20language%20interpreter%2C%20is%20a%20blanket%20term%20for%20a%20certain%20class%20of%20programs%20designed%20to%20read%20lines%20of%20text%20entered%20by%20a%20user%2C%20thus%20implementing%20a%20command-line%20interface.) (e.g. Command Prompt for Windows), and run the following:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```


## How it works

#### 1) Asks for a [URL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/URL) having any amount of downloadable files.

#### 3) Downloads the content expected from the links e.g. Images, Audios, Videos, etc. and skips the links with content like Text, HTML, etc.

#### 4) Creates a dedicated [folder](Downloads) and saves all the downloaded files there!
